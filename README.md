## Insights

### 1. Seasonality Trend

An analysis of store sales data reveals notable seasonal trends. Revenue remains stable for the first eight months, averaging approximately $685K. A significant increase begins in September, with a 40% surge over the previous month. This upward trend continues until November, reaching a peak of $1.5 million, the highest recorded revenue for the year. Due to incomplete data for December, further conclusions cannot be drawn for that period. These findings highlight the seasonal nature of retail sales, with the most substantial growth occurring in the final four months of the year.

### 2. Market Growth Opportunities  

The analysis of the top 10 countries with potential for growth highlights key markets for expansion. The UK is excluded from this assessment due to its already high demand, with the focus placed on regions where demand can be increased. Findings indicate that the Netherlands, Ireland, Germany, and France generate high sales volumes and revenue.

### 3. Customer Purchase Distribution  

An analysis of the top 10 customers reveals minimal variation in their purchase volumes. The highest revenue-generating customer purchased only 17% more than the second highest, indicating a well-distributed revenue stream. This suggests that the business is not overly reliant on a small group of customers, reducing the risk of dependency. Additionally, the low disparity in purchases reflects limited customer bargaining power, positioning the business favorably in the market.
